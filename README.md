# Breakout-Game

Welcome to the Classic Breakout Game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. This simple yet exciting game allows you to control a paddle using the "left" and "right" arrow keys to bounce a ball and break colorful bricks. The objective is to score as many points as possible without losing all your lives.

## Game Features ##
- Paddle Control: Use the "left" and "right" arrow keys to move the paddle horizontally, trying to bounce the ball and prevent it from falling.

- Randomized Brick Colors: The bricks are displayed in randomized colors, making each game unique and visually appealing.

- Indestructible Gray Bricks: Gray bricks are indestructible and cannot be broken. Your goal is to eliminate the colored bricks while avoiding these gray obstacles.

- Scoring System: Every brick you successfully break adds 1 point to your score, which is displayed on the scoreboard.

- Speed Increase: The ball's speed increases every time you score 10 points, making the game progressively more challenging.

- Lives: You start the game with 3 lives. If you miss the ball and it falls below the paddle, you lose a life. The game continues until you run out of lives.

- Game Over: When you lose all your lives, a "Game Over" sign is displayed, and your final score is shown.
